# Van2Share 

Led front end development for this mobile responsive web application that was built for Daimler/ Mercedes USA - Lab 1886. The application allows users to find and book a Mercedes Sprinter Van while also being able to lock and unlock the vehicle directly from the application by implementing a custom built API for special features. 

This repository does not include the backend/functioning setup (in Laravel on Bitbucket). Midway through building front end, the company switched to a private Bitbucket repository and we built out from there. 

*Here you are able to get a feel for the application with a simple click through demo.

**Use 'safnskf' and 'dsankfs' to get past the login page. Any combination of characters will do, but do not use an email.
