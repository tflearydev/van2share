# Van2Share 

Lead front end developer for this mobile responsive web application that was built for DAIMLER/ MERCEDES-BENZ USA (Lab 1886). The application allows users to find and book Mercedes Sprinter Vans while also being able to LOCK and UNLOCK the vehicle directly from the application by implementing a custom built API for special features. 

This repository does not include the backend setup (which is in Laravel on a PRIVATE BITBUCKET). Midway through building front end, the company switched to a private Bitbucket repository and we built out from there. 

*Here you are able to get a feel for the application with a simple click through demo of some of the built out frontend. 

*I HAVE ALSO ATTACHED A LIVE INSTANCE OF THE SITE BELOW (FOR ATL SPRINTERS COMPANY)

**Use 'aaa' and 'aaa' for username and password to get past the login page. Any combination of characters will do, but do not use a valid email for the demo.
